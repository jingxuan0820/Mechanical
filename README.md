# Mechanical
Creation of many modules of mechanical engineering concepts. At last time I hope to have a simulator of mechanisms

- First, it will be created a software that allow to predict the trajectories of a movil, if there is acceleration data

- Second, It will be created a module that allow to create a truss, with movil parts, axis, gears, belts, chains, screws, etc.
for use to design parts, and prove if a particular design is possible. It will have stress and strain calculus in the elastic zone.

- Third, It will have fatigue analysis.

- Four, It will have impact analysis.

For this part, all the software is similar to anothers softwares. I hope to validate this software with the existing softwares.

The next step is to use machine learnig, and different regression analysis to achieve to recommend the best design, respect to 
mechanisms previously selected.
